1. Reverse a string '10 20 30' ==> '30 20 10'
2. return true or false as string
The username should be between 4 & 25
It must start with alphabet letter
It can contain only letters , numbers & underscore
It cant end with underscore

3. 2 different as string 
first is decimal numbers & second is binary number
Goal is to determine how many digits to the binary number needed
to be changes to represent to decimal no correctly(either 0 change to 1 & vice versa)
if ["56" , "011000"] 
program should return 1 bcz only 1 digit needs to be change in the bin number(the first zero need to be 1) to correctly represent 56 to binary

4. Test case 
"oneoneplusfour" 11 + 4 = 15
return 
"onefive"
